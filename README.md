Jessica Akerman is a UK-based multidisciplinary artist, originally raised in Bradford and now living in Bristol, who works across textiles, sculpture, clay, drawing, painting and assemblage.

Her practice investigates how the body interacts with everyday realities—labour, dressing and the awkwardness of being a body among others—often presenting fragmented limbs or abstracted forms in vibrant, market-signage-inspired palettes and playful processes that weave in histories of place.

Akerman has exhibited widely across the UK and Ireland, received funding from Arts Council England, and served as a Lead Artist on Artichoke’s national artwork Processions, for which she created a WWI dazzle-ship-inspired sculptural banner processed through Cardiff in June 2018.

She studied Sculpture at Chelsea College of Art and Art History & French at University College London, developing a practice that subverts systems and codes—spreadsheets, work songs and colonial trade narratives—to create absurdly decorative large-scale drawings and objects.
