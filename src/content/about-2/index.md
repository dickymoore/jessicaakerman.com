Â 

Jessica Akerman explores histories and place through objects, sculpture and installation. Cultural artefacts - such as folk songs, Excel spreadsheets or military symbols - are a starting point to visualise modes of communication and social structures. Her work is often site responsive, and characterised by vibrant colours and an exploration of materials.
