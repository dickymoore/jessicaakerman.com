# About

Jessica Akerman is an artist and maker.

Trained in sculpture and drawing, her work is inspired by social histories, and is expressed in a variety of media. Ongoing themes include military architecture and accessories, gentrification, women's working lives and material processes.

Her recent wearable artworks are made by hand in sustainable leather offcuts, cork, embroidery and veneer. 

In 2018 she celebrated the centenary of women's suffrage with a collectable sew-on patch launched each month. 30% of sales from all patches will go to three charities supporting women and gender equality.

As one of 100 female Lead Artists for _Processions 2018,_ she worked with Made in Roath on a suffrage banner inspired by dazzle ships, with accompanying cardboard armour.

In 2017 she launched _Gerimus,_ finely foil embossed pendants and brooches featuring British Early Warning System architecture.

The _Eyes Open Open Eyes_ brooch series also alludes to surveillance culture, and staying aware in a world where the politics of division is on the rise.

Jessica programmes arts projects and events, such as the Engage conference 2018 at The Whitworth in Manchester on arts and health. She also delivers creative workshops, such as her popular Feminist Badgemaking and Brexit Badgemaking workshops. She is the co-convenor of [_Thinking Drawing 1960 to Now_](https://courtauld.ac.uk/event/contemporary-drawing-1960-to-now), a symposium in 2019 on contemporary drawing at The Courtauld Institute of Art.
