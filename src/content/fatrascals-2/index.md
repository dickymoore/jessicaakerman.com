 **_Exhibition guide - Jessica Akerman, Fat Rascals_**

**_St Anne’s House, July 2023_**

Fat Rascals are cakes local to the area of Yorkshire where Jessica Akerman grew up. Playing with the trickiness of language, the title reflects both the awkwardness of social codes and living up to them: how the body interacts with everyday realities and the awkwardness in being a body amongst others: expectations, judgements and getting things slightly wrong. It is a darkly playful celebration of bodily imperfection and the artist’s own making processes.

  
Fat Rascals includes textile sculptures, gouache paintings, ceramics, an automated artwork  and a temporary edible installation. Together they become a series of tableaux, each made up of fragmented body parts, with recurring motifs of tongues, feet, ankles, cinched waists, fingers and toes. Teetering at the edge of humour, joy, discomfort and embarrassment, the artist explores the line between the hidden and revealed; the active and static. Human morphs into botanical, cartoon into decorative.

  
Drawn to the language of interior design, the colour palette for the show is inspired by Pantone Colour of the Year 2000-2023; taking both pleasure in the aesthetics of visual trends and poking fun at the ways we create meaning and productivity within capitalist structures.

  
Akerman experiments with clays in different states, including porcelain (Josiah Heads and Stopper), polymer clay (finger hooks, Uneven and Crankle), earthenware (various elements), and terracotta slip used as a paint (on the calico bow of Tootsie and onto the cardboard papier mâché of Caught). 

  
Emulsion paint is coated liberally on vinyl flooring and calico, in contrast to the detailed application of gouache in the framed paintings.

  
Wandering Parts is an automated triptych of three paintings that unfurl in a randomly choreographed sequence. Using Ikea electric blinds as a base, creative technologists from Pervasive Media Studio, Tarim, and David Kitschker adapted the blinds to work as a trio on an endless cycle.

  
Huge thanks to Tarim, and David Kitschker for their work on automating Wandering Parts, to Tim Ryan for graphics, to Dicky Moore for installation & tech support.

  
Opening times: Thursday 6 July, 6pm-9pm | Friday 7 July & Saturday 8 July, 12pm-5pm

By appointment until Wednesday 12 July
